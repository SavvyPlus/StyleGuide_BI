### Style Guide: A Living Document


This style guide is build with foundation 5 framework , with Atomic design in mind, we are building on the back of an outdated fork from one of my favourite digital design companies, Sadly this project didn't flourished but in it's ashes we will raise 


The goals for us in creating this type of Living Style Guide are simple:

* Streamline the workflow for designers and developers
* Maintain a consistency of app styles and identity
* Create a focal point for our Design and User Experience work, both for ourselves and for the community

### Long-Term Vision: A Style Guide That Gives Back

We want to usw this page as the foundation of SavvyBI Style, starting with just the basic, we will continue to add pages, frames, an other version that will guide our team through the process of Developing kickass app's

This style guide takes inspiration in simplicity and growth, with attention on colours and shapes, we are planning to build a unique look, that does not shock the user, but welcomes them with precision and warmth
